# Progress - Lead Management System

## What Works

- ✅ **Next.js Application Structure**: App router setup, TypeScript configuration
- ✅ **Supabase Integration**: Database connection established, client configured
- ✅ **Core Components Built**: LeadList, ImportModal, LeadDetailModal components exist
- ✅ **Category Management**: Loading, selecting, and deleting categories functional
- ✅ **Development Server**: Running on localhost:3001 with Turbopack
- ✅ **Basic UI Layout**: Header section, category selection, responsive grid

## What's Broken/Needs Fixing

- ❌ **TailwindCSS Styling**: `rounded-2xl` utility class error breaking styles
- ❌ **CSV Import**: CSVImport component has export/reference error
- ❌ **Component Dependencies**: Some components may have missing imports
- ⚠️ **Node.js Version**: Running on v18, Supabase recommends v20+

## Current Status

**Phase**: Debugging and stabilization
**Last Working State**: Application loads with basic functionality, but styling and import features broken
**Priority**: Fix TailwindCSS configuration and CSVImport component

## Known Issues

1. **TailwindCSS v4 Configuration**: May need updated config for new utility classes
2. **CSVImport Export**: Component definition/export mismatch on line 290
3. **Fast Refresh**: Frequent full reloads due to runtime errors
4. **Multiple Lockfiles**: Workspace root detection warnings

## Features Left to Build/Verify

- [ ] CSV import end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Lead detail editing and saving
- [ ] Lead creation from scratch
- [ ] Data validation and error handling
- [ ] Search/filter functionality
- [ ] Bulk operations on leads
- [ ] Export functionality

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Setup**: Standard Next.js with TailwindCSS
- **Database Choice**: Supabase for real-time features and easy setup
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, local state for UI
- **Component Architecture**: Modal-based UI for lead details
- **CSV Processing**: Papa Parse for robust parsing

## Development Notes

- Terminal shows application is actively running with compilation cycles
- Supabase warnings about Node.js version appear consistently
- Fast Refresh is working but requires full reloads due to errors
- Memory bank documentation now complete for future sessions
