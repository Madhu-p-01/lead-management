# Active Context - Lead Management System

## Current Work Focus
Setting up the memory bank structure for the lead management project to ensure proper documentation and context preservation between work sessions.

## Recent Changes
- Created comprehensive memory bank documentation
- Identified critical technical issues from terminal output
- Application is currently running on localhost:3001

## Immediate Issues to Address

### Critical Issues
1. **TailwindCSS Configuration Problem**
   - Error: `Cannot apply unknown utility class 'rounded-2xl'`
   - Impact: Styling system is broken, affecting UI rendering
   - Location: `app/globals.css` line 1

2. **CSVImport Component Error**
   - Error: `ReferenceError: CSVImport is not defined`
   - Location: `app/components/CSVImport.js` line 290
   - Impact: CSV import functionality is broken

### Secondary Issues
- Node.js version warning (recommends upgrade to v20+)
- Multiple lockfiles causing workspace root detection issues
- Fast Refresh requiring full reloads due to runtime errors

## Current Application Status
- **Server**: Running on localhost:3001 (Turbopack enabled)
- **Database**: Supabase connected and functional
- **Components**: Main page loads but with styling errors
- **Import Feature**: Non-functional due to CSVImport error

## Next Steps Priority
1. Fix TailwindCSS configuration to resolve styling
2. Debug and fix CSVImport component export issue
3. Test CSV import functionality end-to-end
4. Verify all component interactions work correctly

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- Using TypeScript for type safety
- Modular component architecture
- Real-time data with Supabase
- Responsive design with TailwindCSS
- User-friendly error handling with confirmation dialogs
